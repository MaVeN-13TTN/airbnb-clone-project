# AirBnB Clone Project

## Project Overview

This project is a backend implementation of an AirBnB clone, providing a robust and scalable foundation for managing user interactions, property listings, bookings, and payments.

## Project Goals

- User Management: Implement secure user registration, authentication, and profile management
- Property Management: Develop features for property listing creation, updates, and retrieval
- Booking System: Create a booking mechanism for users to reserve properties
- Payment Processing: Integrate a payment system to handle transactions
- Review System: Allow users to leave reviews and ratings for properties
- Data Optimization: Ensure efficient data retrieval and storage

## Technology Stack

- Django: High-level Python web framework
- Django REST Framework: Tools for creating RESTful APIs
- PostgreSQL: Relational database for data storage
- GraphQL: Flexible query mechanism
- Celery: For handling asynchronous tasks
- Redis: Caching and session management
- Docker: Containerization for development and deployment
- CI/CD Pipelines: Automated testing and deployment

## Team Roles

- **Backend Developer**: Responsible for implementing API endpoints, database schemas, and business logic. They develop the core functionality of the application using Django and Django REST Framework.

- **Database Administrator**: Manages database design, schema creation, indexing, and optimizations. They ensure efficient data storage and retrieval through PostgreSQL and implement caching strategies with Redis.

- **DevOps Engineer**: Handles deployment, monitoring, and scaling of the backend services. They set up Docker containers, configure CI/CD pipelines, and ensure the system runs smoothly in production environments.

- **QA Engineer**: Ensures the backend functionalities are thoroughly tested and meet quality standards. They develop and execute test cases, perform integration testing, and identify bugs before deployment.

- **Project Manager**: Coordinates the team's efforts, manages timelines, and ensures project goals are met. They facilitate communication between team members and stakeholders.

- **UI/UX Designer**: Although primarily a backend project, they provide input on API design to ensure it meets frontend requirements and delivers a seamless user experience.

- **Security Specialist**: Reviews code and infrastructure for security vulnerabilities, implements authentication and authorization mechanisms, and ensures data protection compliance.
