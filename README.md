# AirBnB Clone Project

## Project Overview

This project is a backend implementation of an AirBnB clone, providing a robust and scalable foundation for managing user interactions, property listings, bookings, and payments.

## Project Goals

- User Management: Implement secure user registration, authentication, and profile management
- Property Management: Develop features for property listing creation, updates, and retrieval
- Booking System: Create a booking mechanism for users to reserve properties
- Payment Processing: Integrate a payment system to handle transactions
- Review System: Allow users to leave reviews and ratings for properties
- Data Optimization: Ensure efficient data retrieval and storage

## Feature Breakdown

### User Management
The user management system handles user registration, authentication, and profile management. It provides secure login functionality using JWT tokens and allows users to create and update their profiles with personal information and preferences. This feature forms the foundation of the platform by establishing user identity and enabling personalized experiences.

### Property Management
The property management feature enables hosts to create, update, and manage their property listings. Hosts can add detailed property information including descriptions, amenities, pricing, availability calendars, and photo galleries. This feature is essential for building the marketplace inventory and providing comprehensive property information to potential guests.

### Booking System
The booking system facilitates the reservation process between guests and hosts. It handles availability checking, booking requests, confirmations, and cancellations while maintaining the integrity of the booking calendar. This core feature enables the primary business function of the platform by connecting guests with available properties.

### Payment Processing
The payment processing feature securely handles financial transactions between guests and hosts. It manages payment collection during booking, holds funds until check-in, and handles disbursement to hosts after successful stays. This feature ensures financial security and trust in the platform by providing reliable and transparent payment handling.

### Review System
The review system allows guests to rate and review properties after their stay, and hosts to review guests. It calculates and displays average ratings and presents review comments to help future users make informed decisions. This feature builds trust in the platform by providing social proof and accountability for both hosts and guests.

### Search and Filtering
The search and filtering system enables users to find properties based on location, dates, price range, amenities, and other criteria. It implements efficient indexing and query optimization to provide fast and relevant search results. This feature enhances user experience by helping guests quickly find properties that match their specific requirements.

### Notification System
The notification system keeps users informed about important events such as booking confirmations, messages, and upcoming stays. It delivers notifications through multiple channels including email, SMS, and in-app alerts using asynchronous processing. This feature improves user engagement and ensures timely communication between all parties.

### Messaging System
The messaging system facilitates communication between guests and hosts before, during, and after bookings. It provides a secure and organized way to ask questions, share check-in details, and resolve issues. This feature enhances the user experience by enabling clear communication and building trust between users.

## Technology Stack

- **Django**: A high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. Used as the foundation for building our backend application, handling URL routing, view logic, and ORM functionality.

- **Django REST Framework**: A powerful and flexible toolkit for building Web APIs on top of Django. Provides serialization, authentication, and viewsets to create RESTful endpoints for our application.

- **PostgreSQL**: An advanced open-source relational database that provides robustness, performance, and advanced features. Stores all application data including user profiles, property listings, bookings, and reviews.

- **GraphQL**: A query language for APIs that enables clients to request exactly the data they need. Provides a more flexible alternative to REST for complex data fetching requirements.

- **Celery**: A distributed task queue system that handles asynchronous processing. Used for background tasks like sending email notifications, processing payments, and generating reports.

- **Redis**: An in-memory data structure store used as a database, cache, and message broker. Supports Celery as a message broker and provides caching to improve application performance.

- **Docker**: A platform for developing, shipping, and running applications in containers. Ensures consistent environments across development, testing, and production.

- **CI/CD Pipelines**: Automated workflows for continuous integration and deployment. Automates testing, building, and deploying the application to ensure code quality and streamline releases.

- **JWT Authentication**: JSON Web Tokens for secure authentication and authorization. Provides stateless authentication for API requests.

- **Nginx**: A high-performance web server that acts as a reverse proxy. Handles load balancing, SSL termination, and serves static files.
